% Header and Style File for CS170 TeX Files
%
% This package contains references to other packages, new commands, and values
% for different parameters, common to all documents.
% This file should be placed one level above the TeX files in the directory
% tree.
%
% Please modify the appropriate section below with information about
% the class: this information needs to be updated only once per semester.
%
% Compiled by Aditya Baradwaj (abaradwaj@berkeley.edu),
% with significant inspiration taken from CS 70's header.sty file,
% which was compiled and cleaned by Alvin Wan (http://alvinwan.com)
